# Face Recognition Wheelchair

This project implements a Face Recognition Wheelchair using MATLAB and Arduino Uno to provide hands-free mobility for individuals with physical disabilities. The system detects and recognizes the user's face using MATLABâ€™s image processing capabilities and sends movement commands to the Arduino Uno, which controls the wheelchair motors.

Features:
âœ… Face Recognition-Based Control: Detects the userâ€™s face and moves the wheelchair accordingly.
âœ… MATLAB Processing: Uses image processing and machine learning techniques for real-time facial recognition.
âœ… Arduino Integration: Receives movement commands from MATLAB and controls the motors.
âœ… Hands-Free Mobility: Eliminates the need for manual input, enhancing accessibility.

Technologies Used:
MATLAB â€“ Face detection, recognition, and command processing.
Arduino Uno â€“ Motor control and movement execution.
Motor Driver (L298N or similar) â€“ Drives the wheelchair motors.
Camera/Webcam â€“ Captures real-time images for face recognition.
How It Works:
The camera captures the user's face.
MATLAB processes the image to recognize facial features.
Based on recognition, MATLAB sends movement commands to the Arduino Uno.
The Arduino drives the motors to move the wheelchair in the desired direction.
Future Improvements:
ðŸ”¹ Enhance recognition accuracy with deep learning models.
ðŸ”¹ Implement obstacle detection for safer navigation.
ðŸ”¹ Integrate voice or gesture-based control for more flexibility.
